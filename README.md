Score: 100/100 </br>
Retries: 1

The goal of the project is to learn more about the mechanisms of the C language, as well as to work with a large volume of code, which requires a more structured approach to its writing </br>

In this project we need to implement the printf function with these flags:</br>
• %c Prints a single character.</br>
• %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).</br>
• %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.</br>
• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.</br>
• %i Prints an integer in base 10.</br>
• %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.</br>
• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.</br>
• %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.</br>
• %% Prints a percent sign.</br>
